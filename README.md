DAY4
Measures of central tendency
Mean - average
Median - middle value
Mode - most repeated value
Percentile - median is the 50th percentile 
Quartiles -
 Q1- 25th percentile
Q2- 50th percentile
Q3- 75th percentile

IQR = Q3-Q1
LB = Q1-1.5*IQR
UB = Q3+1.5*IQR

Interquartile range
Min
Max

Finding outliers using Quartiles 

Measures of dispersion
Range
Variance & Standard deviation  (x-)2N
Z score -    x- 
Confidence interval


Correlation coefficient(-1 to 1)
Pearson correlation coefficient
Sphearman’s rank correlation

Scatter plot
Visually inspecting correlation b/w two variables


Distribution Curve , Histogram

Boxplot 
Shows median(Q2),Q1,Q3,lowerbound,upperbound,
Outliers
*DAY5
The probability of getting heads or tails in a coin toss is 0.5 because the cumulative sum will reach a value which is near to 0.5.

Gaussian distribution - mean value can be anywhere. Not necessarily zero centred.
Nomal distribution - special case of gaussian distribution. Zero centred mean value.

Sampling 

Population - entire set
Sample - a portion of the set

Central limit theorm - https://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/
Sampling distribution 

Null hypothesis - operations does not have effect
Alternate hypothesis - operations have effect

Significance level - even a small p has significance.

Z = x -   /N
 x  sample mean
   population 
  population of SD

t =  x -     s/N
 s sample’s SD
